# Flack

Flack is a online messaging service, similar in spirit to Slack. It is part of the problems sets that is tasked to learners of [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/summer/web/2019/projects/2/) back in 2019. This was my attempt of using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), with Flask as the backend and Bulma as a Frontend framework to create a real-time chat app. 

Given a choice now (updated in July 2021), I would probably have went for a slightly more "modern" approach of using a JAMStack such as Nextjs with Firebase/Ably to have a more responsive, and perhaps nicer looking UI, that achieves the same effect.
